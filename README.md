Remake of the Snake game

This is a copy of the old Snake game I used to play as a child!

This project is made using HTML CSS and JAVASCRIPT.

For this project I used an adaptation of the MVC Pattern.
There are only two controllers in the code.
Game Contoller witch contains the logic of the game.
Intreface Controller witch displays everything.

You can see this game live at https://rubenstanciu.com/snake.
